# General Usage/Purpose
These files explore the use of API services, both defining an API and using a remote API, within python.

Both files contain basic notation and a simple docstring to clarify code elements and expected usage, but if you think
something needs more explination, let me know!

Orirignal code provided by MicroSoft via Coursera as part of the Python Web Development coursework.

Running the app with a valid API Key and city, will return the current temperature in Kelvin (with F/C conversions) and simple text
description of the weather type (Clear/Sunny/Partial Clouds/etc...)

*The original script and API only provided the Kelvin and weather description, I've simply added the conversions for both (F)ahrenheit and (C)elcius and updated the print format*
